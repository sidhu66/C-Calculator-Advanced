**Project Description: Command-Line Calculator in C**

**Overview:**
This project is a command-line calculator (CLC) implemented in C, providing users with a versatile tool for performing a variety of mathematical operations. The calculator supports basic binary and unary operations, as well as more advanced features involving variables and arrays.

**Features:**

1. **Basic Operations:**
   - Binary mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, exponentiation, maximum, and minimum.
   - Unary mathematical operations including square root, logarithm, exponentiation, ceiling, and floor functions.

2. **Variable Management:**
   - Users can define variables (a, b, c, d, e) and assign them values, allowing for the use of stored values in subsequent calculations.

3. **Advanced Operations:**
   - Advanced mathematical operations involving variables and arrays.
   - Users can perform binary and unary operations using both numerical values and variables.

4. **User-Friendly Interface:**
   - The calculator is designed with a user-friendly command-line interface, providing a menu-driven system for easy navigation.
   - Clear and concise prompts guide users through the input process for numbers, operators, and variables.

5. **Developer Information:**
   - Developed by Karanveer Singh Sidhu.
   - Version: Assignment 1.
   - Date: October 8, 2023.

**How to Use:**
1. Upon launching the calculator, users are welcomed with a message displaying the developer's information and version details.
2. Users are presented with a menu of options, including basic binary and unary operations, advanced operations, variable management, and an option to exit.
3. The calculator provides a simple and interactive interface for users to input numbers, select operations, and view the results.

**Future Enhancements:**
   - Support for additional mathematical functions.
   - Improved error handling and input validation.
   - Graphical user interface (GUI) for a more intuitive user experience.
   - History tracking for previous calculations.

**Note:**
This command-line calculator project serves as an educational tool, offering a foundation for further development and exploration of C programming concepts. Users can leverage the calculator for various mathematical tasks and gain insights into handling variables and arrays in a C programming environment.
